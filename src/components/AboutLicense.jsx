          <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Let&apos;s talk about some fun
          facts here. Did you know?
          <ol>
            <li>
              Octopus Revenge: Octopuses throw objects, including shells and
              silt, at each other when annoyed‚Äîlike underwater tantrums.
            </li>
            <li>
              Chicken T-Rex: Chickens are the closest living relatives to T-Rex.
              Imagine Jurassic Park but with a giant chicken running after you.
              Terrifying, yet oddly delicious?
            </li>
            <li>
              Sloth‚Äôs Bathroom Break: Sloths climb down trees once a week to
              poop. This takes so long it‚Äôs their most dangerous activity,
              making them easy prey. Nature, why?
            </li>
            <li>
              Dolphin Nicknames: Dolphins call each other by unique whistles,
              essentially having names. Somewhere in the ocean, there‚Äôs a
              dolphin named Steve annoying his friends.
            </li>
            <li>
              Banana DNA Drama: Around 50% of a banana‚Äôs DNA matches humans. So
              technically, if we merge two bananas, we could create a
              human-banana hybrid. Wake up evolution? You gotta work! üçåüçå
